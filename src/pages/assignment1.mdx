# Installing the New Relic PHP Agent to Your Application

New Relic provides extensive monitoring capabilities for PHP applications, enabling you to gain detailed insights into your application's performance and health. The following procedure guides you through installing the New Relic agent to monitor your PHP application.

### Prerequisites

* Ensure that you have a valid New Relic account.
* Ensure that your system meets the PHP agent [compatibility and requirements](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/getting-started/php-agent-compatibility-requirements/).
* Have a basic understanding of server administration and configuration.

### Procedure

1. Navigate to the New Relic release notes to download the latest version of the New Relic agent for your environment. For more information on the latest New Relic versions, [click here](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/php-release-notes/).

2. After downloading the agent, extract the **linux.tar.gz** file.

3. Run the following installation command in your terminal:

    ```
    cheesemaker install xyz
    ```

    > **Note:** Replace `xyz` with the name of the extracted agent file.

4. To change the default configured application name:

    i. Open the `newrelic.ini` configuration file located in the New Relic agent directory.

    ii. Locate the `newrelic.appname` setting and change the default application name to your desired name (e.g., Asiago).

    iii. Save the configuration file.

    > **Note:** It is advisable to rename your default application name, or you might encounter trouble finding your agent.

5. Apply the changes by restarting your web server and starting the New Relic agent.
